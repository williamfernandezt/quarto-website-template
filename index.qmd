## Welcome!

I am a PhD candidate in Public Policy at the Research Training Group ([DYNAMICS](https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/en/dynamics)), jointly organized by the [Hertie School](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/) and [Humboldt University](https://www.hu-berlin.de/en).

My research lies at the intersection of economics and demography, and in my dissertation I analyze the impact of late life-course events such as retirement and widowhood on outcomes inlcuding individual wellbeing, labor force participation, and poverty risk. I specialize in quantitative analysis using both descriptive methods and causal inference, focusing on European and Latin American countries.  

Before starting my PhD, I received a Bachelor in Economics from [Universidad del Pacífico](https://www.up.edu.pe/) and a Master of Public Policy from the [Hertie School](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/).

You can find a list of my research projects [here](papers) and my CV [here](cv). Please feel free to [reach out](mailto:w.fernandez@hertie-school.org), I am happy to connect or explore potential collaborations!

## Personal life

I currently live in Berlin, Germany, but I am originally from Lima, Peru. In my free time, I enjoy playing videogames (mostly RPGs), singing in my choir, going to the movies, opera, theater, reading, and creative writing.  You can find a list of the videogames I have played, the movies I have watched, and some reviews [here](hobbies).
