    "text": "Over the centuries, I have devoted countless hours to deciphering and translating the ancient scripts and dialects of the various peoples of Middle-earth. My goal is to gain a deeper understanding of the cultures and histories of these peoples by studying their languages. Currently, I am working on a monograph that explores the linguistic roots of the Elvish languages. Through extensive research and analysis, I hope to shed light on the connections between the different dialects of Elvish and their origins. This project has been particularly challenging, as Elvish is a complex and nuanced language, but I am determined to see it through to completion."

I previously worked as Research Assistant at the Institutions and Political Inequality Unit of the WZB Berlin Social Science Center, and as a Teaching Assistant of Economics and Statistical Methods at the Hertie School. In Peru, I have experience working in quantitative economic research and as a consultant for public sector institutions. My research interests include the life course (with a focus on old-age individuals), retirement, and pension systems.\nI am particularly interested in understanding work to retirement transitions in developed nations."

    "text": "Does retirement make people happy? Evidence from old-age workers in Germany\n\n\nIn this study, I explore the impact of retirement on self-reported life satisfaction among old-age workers in Germany. Utilizing data from the German Socioeconomic Panel (SOEP) linked with administrative pension records from the Deutsche Rentenversicherung (RV), I employ a combination of fixed-effects models and regression discontinuity designs to estimate the causal effect of retirement on satisfaction with life (SWL).\nThe results reveal that retirement leads to a substantial increase in self-reported life satisfaction, a finding that remains robust across various methodologies and after conducting rigorous robustness tests. Moreover, early retirees show a larger increase in SWL compared to individuals who wait until reaching the statutory retirement age to retire. Additionally, the positive effect of retirement persists even beyond the initial two years following retirement."
