In this study, I explore the impact of retirement on self-reported life satisfaction among old-age workers in Germany. Utilizing data from the German Socioeconomic Panel (SOEP) linked with administrative pension records from the Deutsche Rentenversicherung (RV), I employ a combination of fixed-effects models and regression discontinuity designs to estimate the causal effect of retirement on satisfaction with life (SWL). 

The results reveal that retirement leads to a substantial increase in self-reported life satisfaction, a finding that remains robust across various methodologies and after conducting rigorous robustness tests. Moreover, early retirees show a larger increase in SWL compared to individuals who wait until reaching the statutory retirement age to retire. Additionally, the positive effect
of retirement persists even beyond the initial two years following retirement.
